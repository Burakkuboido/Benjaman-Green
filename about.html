          <h1>Get to know me.</h1>
          <p>Im Benjaman Green, but you can just call me Ben.</p>
          <p>Born in the UK. Been working on my web development skills since I was 18 after I started studying Interactive Media at York and graduated in 2022.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm heavily into the design aspect of web development, trying to make the sites I create aesthetically pleasing as much as possible for the users.
            <br>
            <br>
            With each site I create, I try to add one extra element that pushes my limits to see what I am capable of.
            I work indepently but I hope to work for a team in the future so I can gain the invaluable knowledge of teamwork inside the industry.

          <p>I am a fast, steady and hardworking individual. I have mostly studied with technology related devices such as computers, laptops, tablets and mobiles, but what I love most is spreading positivity, it might sound strange but I absolutely love it. It's just the feeling that you get when you know you have made someone smile, or knowing that you have made someone's day. <br><br>II have experience in handling cash, working as a team, communicating, focusing more, self-motivating myself, motivating others, key holding, opening and closing of the store, ordering a delivery and more.</p>

        <div class="col-4 col_02">
          <h1 class="about_headings"><u>Education</u></h1>
          <p>I mostly did courses to do with IT/computers such as business, media, ICT/IT and games development. I have studied Interactive Media at the University of York. I have studied games development at Canterbury College. Before studying at Canterbury, I lived and studied in Folkestone at the Folkestone Academy, here I decided to choose IT, media and business as my three subjects. I succeeded in all three.</p>
          <p>I achieved a 2:1 in Interactive Media, despite having to work full time for the last two years.</p>
